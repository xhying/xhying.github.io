Designed for isolation, these protocols do not have security mechanisms such as message authentication or encryption. In order to secure the CAN protocol, anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed to track physical properties and detect unexpected deviations from their normal behaviors. Voltage-based IDS (VIDS) exploits voltage characteristics for anomaly detection. To measure the voltage of the CAN bus, a VIDS requires additional wires to connect the microcontroller to the CAN bus. As a result, these wires may in turn introduce new attack surfaces to the CAN bus if the VIDS itself is compromised. In this paper, we propose three voltage-based attacks: 1) the overcurrent attack, in which the adversary damages the compromised ECU’s microcontroller by letting the current that flows into an analog pin exceed the maximum amount that the microcontroller can absorb, 2) the denial-of-service attack, in which the adversary prevents any message from being transmitted by setting the CAN bus to an idle state, and 3) the forced retransmission attack, in which the adversary forces an ECU to retransmit by inducing an error during message exchange. To defend against the above attacks, we propose a hardware-based Intrusion Response System (IRS) that disconnects the VIDS from the CAN bus at the onset of the attacks. We demonstrate the proposed attacks on a CAN bus testbed and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Attack Surfaces of Voltage-Based Intrusion Detection Systems in Controller Area Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuhang Ying","Farzad Hessar","Sumit Roy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539324440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539324440,"objectID":"4bca51a885f5d6bbbd73a4191d74a977","permalink":"/publication/2018-elsevier/","publishdate":"2018-10-11T22:07:20-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-elsevier/","section":"publication","summary":"The global transition from analogue to digital over-the-air TV broadcasting has freed up a large portion of spectrum in the United States and in other countries. Meanwhile, in response to the rapidly increasing traffic on wireless access networks the paradigm of shared spectrum, which allows secondary devices to opportunistically access licensed spectrum that is underutilised by primary users (PUs), is being actively explored. In TV bands, research has focused largely on enabling white space (WS) sharing, i.e. co-channel reuse outside the protection region. In this overlay mode, secondary users (SUs) must not operate in the protection region (which consists of the service region and its vicinity and is known as the no-talk zone) to protect primary users (e.g. TV receivers). The existence of no-talk zones is to protect PUs in the boundary service region. In contrast, grey space (GS) sharing is co-channel reuse inside the protection region. In this underlay mode, an SU needs to ensure that the additional interference it contributes is weak enough at nearby PUs to be deemed acceptable. This is facilitated by the presence of built environments within a protection region, i.e. if the secondary is indoors and the primary outdoors, we expect the availability of (indoor) GS and (outdoor, in the vicinity of the buildings) WS to increase, due to the attenuation effects that provide additional inherent protection to primary receivers. The goal of this article is to revisit interference protection criteria for outdoor WS, and extend them to outdoor GS and (further) indoor WS/GS. We carry out a case study for US TV bands to assess the (new) indoor–outdoor WS and GS availability. Our results show that there is more WS indoors than outdoors (as expected); we quantify this as a function of key parameters of the deployment scenario and (importantly) the attention effects of building walls. We also show that there are sufficient GS opportunities in outdoor environments, and many more indoors, leading to the conclusion that the often-repeated folk theorem that ‘white (and grey) spaces don't exist where they are needed most’ needs substantial revision.","tags":[],"title":"Indoor-Outdoor TV White and Gray Space Availability: A U.S. Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuhang Ying","Milind M.

The proposed graph representation allows us to formulate PA CA and GAA CA with binary conflicts as max-cardinality and max-reward CA, respectively. Approximate solutions can be found by a heuristic-based algorithm that searches for the maximum weighted independent set. We further formulate GAA CA with non-binary conflicts as max-utility CA. We show that the utility function is submodular, and the problem is an instance of matroid-constrained submodular maximization.

These protocols were designed under the assumption that separating in-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient for protection against cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid by recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle network. Motivated by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed for in-vehicle networks that attempt to detect attacks by exploiting physical properties such as clock skew of an ECU. In this paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in which an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages to match the clock skew of a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that, while the clock skew is a physical property of each ECU that cannot be changed by the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is based on the timing of network traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an adversary. We implement the proposed cloaking attack and test it on two IDSs, namely, the current state-of-the-art IDS and its adaptation to the widely-used Network Time Protocol (NTP). We implement the cloaking attack on two hardware testbeds, a prototype and a real vehicle, and show that it is able to deceive both IDSs. We also introduce a new metric called the Maximum Slackness Index to quantify the effectiveness of a clock skew-based IDS in detecting masquerade attacks when the adversary is unable to precisely match the clock skew of the targeted ECU.","tags":[],"title":"Cloaking the clock: emulating clock skew in Controller Area Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuhang Ying","Jincheng Zhang","Lichao Yan","Yu Chen","Guanglin Zhang","Minghua Chen","Ranveer Chandra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507788440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507788440,"objectID":"5673683d3c65c5f64c67ea4fbb09c09b","permalink":"/publication/2017-tist/","publishdate":"2017-10-11T22:07:20-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-tist/","section":"publication","summary":"It is a promising vision to exploit white spaces, that is, vacant VHF and UHF TV channels, to meet the rapidly growing demand for wireless data services in both outdoor and indoor scenarios.

An important consideration is fairness between Wi-Fi and duty cycled LTE-U, which is often defined in terms of channel access time, as adopted by the LTE-U Forum. Despite many studies on duty cycle adaptation design for fair sharing, one crucial fact has often been neglected: LTE-U systems unilaterally control LTE-U duty cycles; hence, as selfinterested users, they have incentives to misbehave, e.g., transmitting with a larger duty cycle that exceeds a given limit, so as to gain a greater share in channel access time and throughput. In this paper, we propose a scheme that allows the spectrum manager managing the shared bands to estimate the duty cycle of a target LTE-U cell based on PHY layer observations from a nearby Wi-Fi AP, without interrupting normal Wi-Fi operations. We further propose a thresholding scheme to detect duty cycling misbehavior (i.e., determining if the duty cycle exceeds the assigned limit), and analyze its performance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities. The proposed schemes are implemented in ns3 and evaluated with extensive simulations. Our results show that the proposed scheme provides an estimate within ± 1% of the true duty cycle, and detects misbehavior with a duty cycle 2.8% higher than the limit with a detection probability of at least 95%, while keeping the false alarm probability less than or equal to 1%.","tags":[],"title":"Detecting LTE-U Duty Cycling Misbehavior for Fair Sharing with Wi-Fi in Shared Bands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuhang Ying","Sumit Roy","Radha Poovendran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493967600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493967600,"objectID":"4058fb7bfa72e10d45c2193eab9bd108","permalink":"/publication/2017-tccn/","publishdate":"2017-05-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-tccn/","section":"publication","summary":"Networking on white spaces (i.e., locally unused spectrum) relies on active monitoring of spectrum usage.

Success of such crowd-sensing systems presumes some incentive mechanisms to attract user participation. In this paper, we assume that the platform who constructs radio environment maps makes one-time offers (the incentive for participation) to users, and collects data from those who accept the offers. We design pricing mechanisms based on expected utility (EU) maximization, where EU captures the tradeoff between radio mapping performance (location and data quality), crowdsensing cost, and uncertainty in offer outcomes (i.e., possible expiration and rejection). Specifically, we consider both sequential offering, where one best price offer is sent to the best user in each round, and batched offering, where a batch of offers is made in each round. For the later, we show that EU is submodular in the discrete domain, and propose a mechanism that first fixes the pricing rule, and selects users based on unconstrained submodular maximization (USM); it then compares different pricing rules to find the best batch of offers in each round.

Construction of such protection regions for a transmitter within a database has been done, mainly based on empirical propagation models that estimate the received signal strength at a location. Clearly, such model-based prediction is always of limited accuracy and should be supplemented by measurement based approaches that help validate and improve the database predictions. In this work, we present results based on applying spatial interpolation techniques (Kriging) to measurement data obtained in Seattle, WA. Our results have shown that empirical DBA models tend to over-estimate received signal strengths by not explicitly accounting for local obstructions, while measurement-based Kriging achieves consistently good performance. Furthermore, boundary estimation via Kriging achieves a type I error rate 46.1% lower than comparable DBA approach while keeping type II error rate under a low limit (5%) for a given service threshold (i.e., -84 dBm/6 MHz); this is also an improvement over a method using k-Nearest Neighbor for such estimation.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting TV Coverage Estimation with Measurement-based Statistical Interpolation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xuhang Ying","Jincheng Zhang","Lichao Yan","Guanglin Zhang","Minghua Chen","Ranveer Chandra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380175640,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380175640,"objectID":"b2045463c3ed93675ea070dbd03d72b3","permalink":"/publication/2013-mobicom/","publishdate":"2013-09-25T22:07:20-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-mobicom/","section":"publication","summary":"It is a promising vision to utilize white spaces, i.e., vacant VHF and UHF TV channels, to satisfy skyrocketing wireless data demand in both outdoor and indoor scenarios.
